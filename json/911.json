PyrAmes\u2019 Boppli\u2122 device for critically-ill infants received Breakthrough Device Designation from the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>The company\u2019s proprietary technology is now being further developed to enable monitoring the blood pressure of women at risk of complications from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Blood pressure measurements are one of the standard means of detecting such disorders which have been well documented as significant health risks to both mother and child.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be working with March of Dimes to accelerate the development of products for neonatal and maternal health applications,\u201d said Xina Quan, Ph.D., PyrAmes Co-founder and CEO. \u201cThis is a wonderful opportunity to work with leaders in the field who will help us enable better outcomes for moms and babies through more effective blood pressure monitoring.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>March of Dimes stays current on the latest scientific breakthroughs and solutions in the market that can impact maternal and infant health through earlier diagnosis, new treatments for conditions during and after pregnancy, and ongoing mental and physical health support.\u00a0 PyrAmes was selected as the third investment for March of Dimes\u2019 Innovation Fund, a venture philanthropy initiative that invests in promising companies with a proven or strong potential to improve outcomes for moms and babies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany babies\u202fwill spend their earliest days in the NICU due to preterm birth, birth defects, surgical or genetic conditions, or other diagnoses. Some of these babies have unstable blood pressure values that require careful monitoring to avoid serious complications,\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth Cherot, Sr. Vice President, Chief Medical and Health Officer of March of Dimes. \u201cAs our third Innovation Fund investment, it is our hope that this partnership will better support babies born too sick or too soon as well as help improve future treatments for pregnant moms with hypertensive disorders like preeclampsia.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>High blood pressure puts extra stress on the heart and can contribute to cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of maternal deaths in the U.S. March of Dimes is committed to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes related to cardiovascular disease.<\/p>\n<p>March of Dimes and PyrAmes are eager to see how the company\u2019s non-invasive, wearable, continuous blood pressure monitoring technology will benefit moms and babies. PyrAmes\u2019 first commercial product, Boppli, will be available after FDA 510(k) clearance, anticipated in 2023.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About PyrAmes Boppli\u2122 and Bosimi\u2122 Devices<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>PyrAmes devices are wearable bands designed to be versatile noninvasive blood pressure monitoring platforms, ideal for infants in the NICU (Boppli) or women during and after pregnancy (Bosimi). They are intended to provide a safer option to arterial lines and a more convenient choice to standard blood pressure cuffs, and have the potential to revolutionize the standard of care for continuous blood pressure monitoring.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About March of Dimes\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marchofdimes.org\/ways-to-give\/march-dimes-innovation-fund\">March of Dimes<\/a> leads the fight for the health of all moms and babies.
