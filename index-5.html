<h2><em style="font-size: 16px;">Boppli provides essential clinical information for newborns undergoing critical care</em></h2>
<p>Cupertino, CA, September 29, 2023 — PyrAmes Inc., a digital health company pioneering innovative blood pressure (BP) monitoring solutions, today announced it has received FDA 510(k) clearance for its revolutionary Boppli<sup>® </sup>platform to continuously and non-invasively monitor the blood pressure of critically-ill infants. <strong>Boppli offers safe and accurate BP monitoring as an alternative to invasive arterial lines (IAL) and intermittent cuff-based measurements.</strong> Boppli previously received Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA, recognizing its potential to enable more timely identification of life-threatening conditions. It is the only commercially-available, continuous and non-invasive BP monitoring solution for infants.</p>
<p>Boppli improves ease of use and avoids the risks and costs associated with IALs. Boppli also eliminates the cumbersome and time-consuming nature of standard cuff-based measurements, which provide only occasional spot BP values and may be prone to inaccuracies. Boppli accuracy was demonstrated to be within FDA guidelines during a rigorous, pivotal clinical study by comparing Boppli sensor data against simultaneous IAL data for critically ill infants in multiple neonatal intensive care units (NICU) in the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p><span id="more-922"></span></p>
<p>“Boppli will provide us with the ability to non-invasively and continuously monitor blood pressure in our tiny, fragile babies – accurately and without disturbing them,” said Lamia Soghier, MD, MEd, MBA, Medical Director and Quality &amp; Safety Officer of the NICU at Children’s National Hospital. “This is a game-changer, as we no longer have to worry about spending time sticking infants multiple times in multiple places to put in an arterial line. I am also excited that we will avoid arterial line complications. As a clinician who has seen terrible loss of fingers from thrombosis of arterial lines, I am thrilled that we now have a safer modality. We will be able to place Boppli quickly, even for our tiny 500g infants. As one of the centers in PyrAmes’ clinical study, we saw first-hand the value that Boppli provided to medical care in the NICU.”</p>
<p>Boppli integrates capacitive sensors that are placed on the arm and/or leg of infants to acquire pulse waveform measurements. The systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures are then inferred from the recorded pulse waveform data using algorithms trained with artificial neural network techniques.</p>
<p>“We are excited to have Boppli, our company’s first product, cleared by the FDA,” said Xina Quan, Ph.D., PyrAmes Co-founder and CEO. “Detecting clinically-important blood pressure information in a safe and timely way with a non-invasive approach has the potential to provide life-changing clinical information for hundreds of thousands of fragile babies without the risks and costs of today’s standards of care.”</p>
<p>“As PyrAmes&#8217; commercial partner, we are excited to introduce these innovative products, empowering NICU doctors and nurses with Boppli&#8217;s first-of-its kind Non-Invasive Blood Pressure technology,&#8221; stated Bob Cormier, President of Sentec North America. &#8220;Boppli addresses a crucial need in non-invasive monitoring for neonatal patients, potentially transforming the well-being of these delicate, precious patients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Boppli’s FDA market clearance represents a first step in PyrAmes’ robust product roadmap to enable more convenient, clinically-accurate, blood pressure monitoring for inpatients and outpatients of all ages, beginning with babies and their mothers to support their health before and after childbirth.</p>

<p>PyrAmes&#8217; goal is to develop more convenient, clinically-accurate, blood pressure monitoring for all patients, including both mothers and babies in order to support enhancing their health before and after childbirth. PyrAmes’ Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> device for critically-ill infants received Breakthrough Device Designation from the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<p><span id="more-911"></span></p>
<p>The company’s proprietary technology is now being further developed to enable monitoring the blood pressure of women at risk of complications from hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, such as gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Blood pressure measurements are one of the standard means of detecting such disorders which have been well documented as significant health risks to both mother and child.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to be working with March of Dimes to accelerate the development of products for neonatal and maternal health applications,” said Xina Quan, Ph.D., PyrAmes Co-founder and CEO. “This is a wonderful opportunity to work with leaders in the field who will help us enable better outcomes for moms and babies through more effective blood pressure monitoring.”</p>

<p>The paper, <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/7/3690">Clinical Study of Continuous Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring in Neonates</a>, highlights the performance of PyrAmes’ novel algorithm-based blood pressure sensor. Boppli is designed to meet the blood pressure monitoring requirements and physical dimensions of small, prematurely-born infants, without external calibration. Boppli uses machine-learning techniques to extract blood pressure values from the shape of the pulse waveform, and is currently being considered for market clearance by the FDA as a Class II medical device.</p>
<p>The paper indicates the use of Boppli is feasible for critically ill term and preterm infants with a wide variety of pathologies—from serious cardiac ailments, pre- and post-operative cases, neurologic conditions, and prematurity.</p>

The goal of the <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/newsroom/news/040323-RadxTech-Deep-Dive">RADx Challenge</a> is to improve maternal health outcomes for those who live in areas lacking access to maternity care through innovative promising home-based or point-of-care diagnostic devices, wearables, and other remote sensing technologies.</p>
<p>PyrAmes’ submission, <em>Non-invasive, Continuous Blood Pressure Monitoring for Postpartum Maternal Health</em>, focuses on its Bosimi<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> platform, a noninvasive, wearable sensor designed to monitor blood pressure of women in their postpartum period, when the risk of maternal mortality is highest.</p>
<p><span id="more-905"></span></p>
<p>For high-risk pregnancies, it is advised to frequently monitor new mothers to obtain important BP trend information potentially indicating the onset of an adverse event. Bosimi is designed to enable more frequent blood pressure monitoring than current standards of care, potentially resulting in better control of blood pressure and timely treatment if adverse events are detected.</p>
<p>During the final RADx Technology Assessment phase, PyrAmes will work its NIH team to accelerate development of Bosimi, by leveraging NIH support to overcome technological, clinical, usability, regulatory, and commercialization hurdles.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to continue working with our NIH RADx team through the end of this year and into 2024 to accelerate Bosimi development for critical postpartum maternal health needs,” said Xina Quan, Ph.D., PyrAmes CEO and Co-founder. “The prospect of providing greater access for postpartum women to more effective blood pressure monitoring in the critical weeks after birth is wonderful opportunity,” she indicated.</p>
<p>NIH RADx received more than 80 submissions for the RADx Challenge’s initial Viability Assessment phase, with 15 companies advancing to the follow-on Deep Dive phase. Proposals were evaluated against a rigorous set of scientific, technical, regulatory, clinical, and commercialization requirements.</p>

<p>PROVIDENCE, RI and CUPERTINO, CA, September 13, 2022 — Sentec and PyrAmes have established a commercial partnership to bring Boppli, PyrAmes’ first-of-its-kind continuous noninvasive blood pressure device, to neonatal intensive care teams throughout the United States. Boppli has received Breakthrough Device Designation from the US Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) and will be available after FDA 510(k) clearance, which is anticipated in the first half of 2023.</p>
<p>“We are excited to join forces with Sentec to commercialize our Boppli product,” said Xina Quan, PhD, Co-Founder and CEO of PyrAmes. “This important step enables us to bring our breakthrough technology to market and transform patient care. We believe Sentec is an ideal partner for us in the NICU, given our companies’ shared mission and focus on noninvasive technologies to enable better healthcare delivery.”In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) today, a baby’s blood pressure is either monitored continuously through an invasive arterial catheter or intermittently through cuff measurements. Both techniques present certain clinical challenges. The Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> platform offers a new solution to overcome those challenges.</p>
<p><span id="more-874"></span></p>
<p>“Blood pressures can be difficult to obtain with a cuff, especially in our tiny neonatal patients where the cuffs are too big which impacts accuracy. Arterial lines are the alternative, but any invasive line increases the risk of infection, so we are always trying to remove them earlier if we can. A non-invasive option that provides continuous, accurate measurements would be an important step forward so we can keep a close eye on our babies without causing them pain or overstimulation,” said Lamia Soghier, MD, MEd, MBA, Medical Director and Quality &amp; Safety Officer of the NICU at Children’s National Hospital.</p>
<p>Recent clinical research for neonates has highlighted the importance of neuroprotective care for premature infants, providing an optimal sensory environment for babies who should otherwise still be in utero. Everything from sound and light levels to the frequency of painful or stimulating procedures (such as blood draws, cuff measurements, suctioning, or even diapering) can impact proper neurological development. More and more, NICUs are creating quality care bundles with the goal of systematically providing neuroprotective care and improving neurological outcomes for their patients.</p>
<p>Sentec’s flagship transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring technology has been adopted by top NICUs around the world looking to keep a close eye on their patients’ respiratory status while limiting painful and invasive blood draws. The exclusive distribution partnership between PyrAmes and Sentec will allow Sentec customers to be among the first NICUs to adopt the Boppli solution.</p>
<p>“We are humbled and enthusiastic about offering our healthcare customers yet another option for noninvasive monitoring that advances their goals of providing less invasive, more neuroprotective care in this critical and vulnerable patient population,” said Bob Cormier, President of Sentec North America. “We are confident that our partnership with PyrAmes will provide value to our companies, our customers, and most importantly, to patients.”</p>
<p><strong>About Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></strong></p>
<p>The Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is designed to be a highly-advanced noninvasive blood pressure monitoring platform that is ideal for infants in the NICU. It is intended to provide a safer option to arterial lines for patients who require continuous blood pressure measurements and has the potential to revolutionize the standard of care for continuous blood pressure monitoring for neonates. PyrAmes’ devices are designed to be noninvasive, wireless, silent, and easier to use than a standard blood pressure cuff. The Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Band is a single-use, self-powered blood pressure monitor worn on the arm or leg of an infant to wirelessly stream data to a bedside device which continuously displays mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate.</p>
<p><strong>About Digital Transcutaneous Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>Noninvasive transcutaneous monitoring allows physicians in the NICU to monitor carbon dioxide levels continuously and painlessly through patients’ skin. Continuously monitoring CO<sub>2 </sub>levels in real time provides an indication of safe levels of cerebral blood flow as well as the efficacy of ventilatory support for patients’ immature or compromised lungs.</p>
<p>Blood draws are the gold standard for accurate CO<sub>2</sub> information, but they present issues in the NICU such as blood loss, infection, and pain, with one study revealing NICU patients experiencing up to 17 painful procedures per day, largely due to blood draws driven by the desire for visibility to CO<sub>2</sub> levels. Transcutaneous monitoring provides accurate CO<sub>2 </sub>information without drawing blood and has been shown to result in a decrease in blood draws on ventilated patients in the NICU.</p>
<p><strong>About Sentec </strong></p>
<p>Sentec is a market leader of noninvasive monitoring solutions who develops, manufactures, and markets patient-centric, cost-effective technologies and products that provide clinicians with greater insight to quickly to identify trends, rapidly and more accurately assess patient status, and make well-informed, timely care decisions that can improve patient care. Sentec is driven by the belief that noninvasive monitoring should enable the delivery of less invasive care.</p>
<p><strong>About PyrAmes </strong></p>
<p>PyrAmes is a digital health company focused on fundamentally transforming the delivery of health care through continuous blood pressure monitoring that is accurate, wireless, and noninvasive. The comfort and ease of use of its platform has the potential to provide better blood pressure management for patients ranging from newborns to seniors. The FDA has recognized the company’s lead product Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> with Breakthrough Device Designation.

<p>“These companies represent the top of the diverse pool of innovative ideas and companies who applied to our Mission for the Future challenge to address the challenges facing our community. In these companies, we see great potential opportunities to explore transformative changes that will take our commitment of innovating for a better life to the next phase,” said LG NOVA Head Dr. Sokwoo Rhee, senior vice president for innovation at LG Electronics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cupertino, CA, &#8212; (Marketwired &#8211; April 20, 2021) –</strong> <a href="https://pyrameshealth.com/">PyrAmes, Inc.</a>, a digital healthcare company focused on innovative products for continuous blood pressure monitoring, today announced the completion of a $6 million Series A financing. The investment round was led by <a href="https://gsrventuresglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSR Ventures</a>, with co-investments from <a href="http://www.keytonevc.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keytone Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.xtxmarkets.com/ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XTX Ventures</a> and other investors.</p>
<p><span id="more-315"></span></p>
<p><em>“We are very pleased to secure this financing, which will accelerate the commercialization of our novel products for the benefit of both patients and clinicians,”</em> said Xina Quan, PhD, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, PyrAmes. <em>“We are also thrilled to have the support of experienced digital healthcare investors such as GSR Ventures, Keytone Ventures and XTX Ventures, and world-renowned clinicians such as Dr. Thomas Fogarty, Dr. Thomas Krummel, and Dr. Peter Fitzgerald, as we develop our innovative platform.” </em></p>
<p>Proceeds from the financing will be used to further develop the Company’s technology through pilot-scale manufacturing, clinical validation studies, and regulatory agency reviews. The Company’s lead product, <a href="https://pyrameshealth.com/our-platforms/boppli-platform/">Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></a>, is designed for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). At present, the only means for obtaining continuous blood pressure measurements in the NICU is to insert an arterial catheter, which is highly-invasive and can lead to severe complications for patients. Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is a wireless sensor band that can easily be placed around the baby’s wrist or foot. It is intended to continuously measure blood pressure without the risks associated with an invasive arterial line. Follow-on products are planned for adults in both inpatient and at-home settings.</p>
<h2>About PyrAmes</h2>
<p>PyrAmes is a development-stage digital health company focused on transforming the delivery of health care through continuous blood pressure monitoring that is accurate, wireless and non-invasive. The comfort and ease of use of our platform has the potential to provide better blood pressure management for patients ranging from newborns to seniors.</p>
<p>The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device Designation for our lead product Boppli<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, which fills the unmet need of monitoring the blood pressure of critically ill infants when an invasive arterial catheter cannot be used due to the risk of complications and adverse effects.
